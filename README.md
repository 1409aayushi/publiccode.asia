# PMPC Web Site

[![Build Status](https://drone.fsfe.org/api/badges/pmpc/website/status.svg)](https://drone.fsfe.org/pmpc/website)

This website is the core of the "Public Money, Public Code" campaign. It is
based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a modern static website generator.

The page is visible at [publiccode.eu](https://publiccode.eu). Please do not
spread this URL. The website requires authentication to be visited. Username is
`pmpc`, password is `publicmoneypubliccode`. Please do not spread this
information to outside people not involved in the website development.

## Contributing to the website

### Prerequisites

In order to modify the website, you need `hugo` and `git` installed on your
computer. If Hugo isn't available in your package manager, obtain it from its
[official website](https://gohugo.io). We tested the website build with Hugo
from version 0.20.7 upwards. Please make sure that you use an as recent version
as possible to avoid errors.

### Configuring Git

First of all, you'll need an account on git.fsfe.org. In the FSFE's wiki,
you'll find [information about our Git
service](https://wiki.fsfe.org/TechDocs/Git), how to get access, and some
guides for basic procedures like configuration, commits, and pushes.

As part of the campaign team you can get full write access to this repository.
Please contact one of [pmpc](https://git.fsfe.org/pmpc)'s admins to give your
account the necessary privileges.

### Cloning the website

Although the mentioned Git guides will enable you to understand how to download
the website's repository, here's a short howto: Navigate to a directory on your
computer where you want the PMPC website to be stored. In this example, it's
`FSFE/PMPC/website` in your user's directory.

```sh
mkdir -p ~/FSFE/PMPC/                           # Create the directory if it doesn't exist yet
cd ~/FSFE/PMPC/                                 # go to the newly created PMPC directory
git clone git@git.fsfe.org:pmpc/website.git     # clone the website to the folder website
```

In the newly created folder `pmpc-website` you'll find all source files the
website consists of now. The hugo files are located under `site/`, whereas in
the root directory you'll only find files informational files and those
relevant for our build process (Drone, Ansible, Docker, Apache).

### Translate

Visit [TRANSLATE.md](https://git.fsfe.org/pmpc/website/src/master/TRANSLATE.md)
for detailed instructions how to translate publiccode.eu.

### Build locally

To see a preview of the website you need to have Hugo installed and be able to
execute Bash scripts in your command line.

1. Navigate to the website's root directory (in the last example
   `~/FSFE/PMPC/website/`) and open a terminal window there. Type in
   `git pull`. This will get the latest changes from the server
2. In the terminal, execute `cd site/` to navigate in the right
   directory for hugo's website build. You are now in
   `~/FSFE/PMPC/website/site/`
3. In your terminal, execute `./build/build.sh server`. This command
   will build the website and enable you to browse the result on your
   computer only. Open [localhost:1313](localhost:1313) in your web
   browser to see it.

If you want to make changes to the official website, please read [our
Git guides](https://wiki.fsfe.org/TechDocs/Git). There you'll find out
about the necessary commands pull, status, add, commit, or push.

Beginners can directly commit to the repository which saves them some
steps, but they have to ask @max.mehl or @jonas in advance to give them
the necessary permission. For more experienced Git users we recommend
the Fork & Pull Request workflow, which you'll also find in the [wiki's
Git Guides
section](https://wiki.fsfe.org/TechDocs/Git#Guides_on_specific_actions)
(not available yet).


## Important file paths

The website structure is very easy. The most important files and directories are:

- `site/config-static.toml`: Static texts and URLs which are the same
  for any language
- `site/languages/strings.{en,fr...}.toml`: Headlines, site title, many
  texts for the various languages.
- `site/content`: Markdown-files for sub-pages like /openletter, can be
  translated
- `site/data/{en,de...}/share`: Services and their very short
  translatable strings where people can share to. Is being used in the
  "Spread" section and the left-side sharing icons
- `site/static/`: CSS, images, and Javascript files for the design.
- `site/static/css/custom.css`: File where all custom CSS code should be
  written to.
- `site/layouts/`: HTML structure (scaffold) for the website. Useful if
  you want to add another section or modify anchor links or CSS classes.
- `site/layouts/page`: Template for a sub-page like /privacy
- `site/layouts/shortcodes`: HTML/Hugo code which can be important from
  within a Markdown file
- `site/public/`: Built files which are used to display the website.
  Generated by running `hugo`.


## Technical information about the online build

The FSFE uses Drone to automatically deploy the PMPC website. The
website is automatically deployed when there's a push to the master
branch of the repository, as well as once an hour (to update
signatures).
